Proof 1
Assuming that the average case leads to the absolute case:
For all Z, there is an a in Z such that 0 < a < 1

Testing the Hypothesis
    Ho There is no integer between 0 and 1  
    H1 There is an integer between 0 and 1

Proof:
  Suppose there is a number in a in Z that is also in between 0 and 1. Then means that there is a whole number, a number that is not a fraction in between 0 and 1. This also means that
  There is a certain distance moveable from 0 and or 1 such that the end point k of that distance is neither a fraction, nor negative. (Given that there is no negative number between 0 and 1)
  That means there is a non-negative whole number 0+k, or 1-k that is a whole number. 
  Taking the case that 1-k = a. Then a+k = 1.
  The problem here is that we are introducing the possibility of another integer, therefore sprouting another problem. But let us plug this hole and assume k itself a fraction,
  the addition to a of which will still maintain the  property that a is an integer, and the fraction added to it will produce one. There already is the contradiction however that 
  a+k =1, because a+k should be < 1.
  lets assume though a fraction 1/j to represent k
  
  a +1/j = 1
  aj+1 = j
  0 = aj -j+1
  j = aj+1
  Testing cases for which the above statement is true:
  1. j= 0
  0=0+1 False
  1 = a(1) +1
  The only integer that makes the above true is when a = 0. 
  
  Therefore from the right side, there are no cases when a fraction is added to a that we get 1. We have found a contradiction. From the right.
  
  Taking the case that 0+k = a, from the left. Then  0= a-k
  Then a = k. 
  dividing through by a
  0 < 1 < 1/a
  The only known case where a !=0 that the above makes sense is when a =1 
  0 < 1 < 1 is false, therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
  
  
  
Note: There is a Proof Conserning the Parity of Consecutive Integers

"Any two positive integers have opposite parity"
