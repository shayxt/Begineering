If one positive integer divdes a second positive integer, then the first is less than or equal to the second. 
The only divisors of 1 are 1 and -1. 

Theorem A
For all integers a and b, if a and b are positive and a divides b, then a<=b
Proof
Given from then above initial statements
            1 <= k
b = ak --> b is a multiple of a , e.g if b = 2a, then b is a double of a. For this to be true, a has to be <= b

This relationship therefore holds that a<=ka because a.1 <= a.k,, and ak = b
So the theorem has been proved. 


Theorem B
For all integers a, b and c, if a divides b, and b divides c, then a divides c
if a|b, b|c, then a|c
Proof
We know that b/a = r, b = ar     //some integer r
And c/b = s, c = bs              //some integer s
Then c = ars    //because b = ar
So c = a(rs), therefore c|a

if d does not divide n, then n/d is not an integer

Theorem C
if a/b and b/a, then a = b, this is false because -2 and 2 divide each other, but -1 != 1

A prime number is identified by the property that it is not divisible by any integer greater than 1 and less than itself. Given also that prime p is not divisible by any integer 
greater than itself either.
