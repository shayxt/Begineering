The product of 2 odd numbers is odd


Proof
let two odd numbers be m and n, and let the product of m and n be an odd number 2r + 1
Because m is odd, we can denote it further as 2p + 1
Similarly for q, we can denote it further as 2q + 1
So while mn = 2r+1
(2p + 1)( 2q + 1) = 2 r + 1
4pq + 2(p+q) + 1 = 2r + 1
2(2pq+(p+q)) + 1 = 2r + 1
r = (2pq+(p+q))
