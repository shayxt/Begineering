Solomon Method: A Slow But Steady Dive Into Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Games
Is this a decision problem?
//Error Detection
//For all Z=> 0, an integer a is either even or odd 
a%2 therefore should yield either 0 or 1
A Solomon Method is a "primitve" yet intuitive method to check to when a system performs a Type Error (incorrectly rejecting the null), 
i.e where the system incorrectly identifies/flags a%2 as 0 or 1.

Set "is_Mother" intersects with "is_bio_Parent"

bool is_Mother;

if (is_Mother.selfAbort()) {          //is_Mother still in doubt
    is_Mother = true}
elseif (is_Mother.otherAbort()){     //s:t otherAbort ~ selfSave
    is_Mother = false}
else
    //cointoss(n);
    
The arguable question here is not whether it is the Judge that gets to decide what a mother is/is not, but how widely the notion of motherly instincts is accepted. 
The safer base zone is what instinct statistically suggests, and as such again, instinct is closer to a mechanistic process than a "socially agreed upon" construct. 
Brings to mind a twisting of the question, "Do all mothers who save babies also save themselves". 

Bertrand Russels Paradox
"The barber cannot shave himself as he only shaves those who do not shave themselves. Thus, if he shaves himself he ceases to be the barber."

Updated solution based on complexity: a variable-state barber, such that barber updates it's state when shaving self. A parallel barber (inverted barber) will be required to 
associate itself with barber, on the condition that barber exists, and barber is variable state.
