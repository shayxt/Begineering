Solomon Method

//Error Detection
//For all Z=> 0, an integer a is either even or odd 
a%2 therefore should yield either 0 or 1
A Solomon Method is a "primitve" yet intuitive method to check to when a system performs a Type Error (incorrectly rejecting the null), 
i.e where the system incorrectly identifies/flags a%2 as 0 or 1.
